# Predicting-Disease-Outbreaks using Unsupervised ML Techniques: DBSCAN!


[79 villages in Pune declared vulnerable to Zika virus - Cities News - Google Chrome 8_11_2021 4_44_39 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54360488/129195846-d2cffd16-2f3e-46b1-8dfd-c0db3fd1a431.png)

__The daily deluge of news headlines is too overwhelming to be analyzed manually due to the limited resources of the WHO and the large quantity of data. The WHO therefore needs data scientists to extract geographic information from the headlines and determine if and where there are clusters of disease outbreaks. This critical information will be used to dispatch resources where they are needed.__

__Objectives__

* *Extract the locations (city and/or country name) from each news headline*.
* *Find the geographic coordinates of each headline using the city/country*.
* *Cluster (group) the headlines based on the geographic location*.
* *Visualize the clusters on a map and analyze them for patterns indicating an epidemic*.
* *Investigate the largest clusters for signs of disease outbreaks*.
* *Review headlines in the largest clusters within the United States and around the world. If any disease outbreak is particularly dominant, visualize all worldwide mentions of that disease.*


**Techniques employed**


* Extracting city and country name data from text using regular expressions  
 * *re: text extraction with regular expressions* 

* Manipulating data and matching location names to geographic coordinates  
* *pandas: data manipulation and analysis*

* Clustering geographic coordinates with k-means and/or DBSCAN  
* * *scikit-learn: machine learning*

* Visualizing clusters on a geographic map  
* * *basemap: geographic visualization*

* Analyzing algorithm output and tuning model settings to improve result

* Sorting between clusters based on size and within clusters based on distance  
* * *matplotlib: general visualization*

* Interpreting algorithm results in the problem domain

* Summarizing findings of a data science project effectively  
* * *nbconvert: converting Jupyter Notebooks to reports*
